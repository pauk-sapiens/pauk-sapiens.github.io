summary: Cleo, a senior black cat, found a loving home after spending years in a shelter, proving that older pets have just as much love to give. (...)



At 10 years old, Cleo had spent nearly half her life in the shelter after her previous owner passed away. Though she was calm and affectionate, many potential adopters overlooked her, choosing younger cats instead.
That changed when Sarah, a young woman living on her own, visited the shelter looking for a mature, calm companion. She immediately connected with Cleo’s gentle demeanor. Now, Cleo enjoys her golden years in a cozy home, spending her days on Sarah’s lap and relishing the love and attention she waited so long for.
